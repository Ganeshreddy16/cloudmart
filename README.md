# ðŸ›’ CloudMart â€“ MultiCloud, DevOps & AI Challenge

This project is a result of the **MultiCloud, DevOps & AI Bootcamp Challenge** - a 5-day intensive program where I rearchitected a legacy e-commerce platform using modern cloud-native and AI technologies.

> **Certified by The Cloud Bootcamp**  
> Built by: **Sri Hari Ganesh Reddy Konala**

##  Project Overview

CloudMart is a fictional retail company undergoing a digital transformation. After restructuring its team, the company aimed to migrate its outdated infrastructure to the cloud, modernize deployment using DevOps pipelines, and integrate AI to reduce customer support costs.

This repository contains all the source code, infrastructure-as-code, Kubernetes manifests, and AI integrations required to deploy and manage CloudMart on AWS, with extensions to Azure and GCP.


## Project Goals

- Migrate CloudMart to AWS using Terraform and EKS
- Deploy microservices via Kubernetes with GitHub CI/CD
- Integrate AI services across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- Enable real-time analytics and customer sentiment tracking
- Use AI tools like Claude and OpenAI to assist with infrastructure automation
